# Clinical Attendance & Personal Time

Students are required to attend all scheduled clinical hours as assigned. Clinical schedules are established in conjunction with the program and clinical site and are expected to be followed without exception.

### Reporting Absences
If a student must miss a clinical day:
- Notify the **Clinical Instructor** and **Program Clinical Coordinator** prior to the shift start time.
- Document the absence in **Trajecsys** using the appropriate absence code.

### Personal Time
Students are allowed **3 personal days** per semester for excused absences. These must be pre-approved and documented. Beyond 3 days, the absence is considered **unexcused** unless supporting documentation is provided.

### Tardiness
Students must be clocked in and ready by their scheduled start time. Repeated tardiness will result in written warning and may impact clinical evaluations.

### Make-Up Time
Students may be required to make up clinical time to meet program hour requirements. All make-up time must be coordinated in advance and approved by the Program Clinical Coordinator.

### Early Dismissal
Leaving clinical early without approval may result in disciplinary action. Always report early outs in **Trajecsys** and notify your Clinical Instructor.

### Summary
The program expects professionalism, punctuality, and accountability. Chronic attendance issues may lead to probation or dismissal per clinical policy.
