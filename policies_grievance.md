# Grievance & Appeals

The Radiation Therapy Program encourages open communication and provides a clear process for addressing student concerns related to clinical education.

### Step 1: Informal Resolution
Students are encouraged to resolve concerns directly and informally when possible.

- First, discuss the concern with the **Clinical Instructor** or preceptor involved.
- If unresolved, the student should then meet with the **Site Clinical Coordinator** or **Program Clinical Coordinator**.

Most concerns can be effectively addressed at the site level through respectful discussion.

---

### Step 2: Formal Grievance
If the concern is not resolved informally, the student may initiate a formal grievance.

To file a formal grievance:
- Submit a **written statement** outlining the issue, actions taken to resolve it, and the desired outcome.
- Submit the statement to the **Program Clinical Coordinator** and **Program Director**.

A written response will be provided within **10 business days** of receiving the grievance.

---

### Step 3: Appeal
If the student is unsatisfied with the formal response, they may appeal the decision to the **School of Applied Studies Dean**.

- The appeal must be submitted in writing within **5 business days** of receiving the program’s response.
- The Dean’s decision is final and binding.

### Non-Retaliation
Students who submit grievances or appeals in good faith will not be subject to retaliation. The program encourages professionalism and accountability in all communication.

---

### Documentation
All grievances and appeals are documented and maintained in a secure location by the Program Director.

---

This process ensures students have a fair and structured means to resolve concerns while maintaining the integrity of the clinical learning environment.
