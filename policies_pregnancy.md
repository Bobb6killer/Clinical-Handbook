# Pregnancy Policy

The Washburn Radiation Therapy Program complies with federal regulations concerning declared pregnancy in clinical education settings, particularly those outlined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

### Declaration of Pregnancy (Voluntary)
- A student who becomes pregnant **may voluntarily declare** their pregnancy in writing to the Program Clinical Coordinator.
- The declaration must include the **estimated date of conception**.
- Students are **not required** to declare pregnancy. All student health information is confidential.

### Options Following Declaration
Once declared, students have the following options:

1. **Continue clinical education without modification**  
   Proceed through all scheduled clinical activities with no special accommodations.

2. **Request accommodations**  
   Modify clinical activities based on physician recommendation or personal comfort, such as limiting exposure near radioactive sources or brachytherapy.

3. **Take a leave of absence**  
   Temporarily withdraw from clinical education and resume at a later date, based on program availability and scheduling.

4. **Withdraw declaration**  
   Students may rescind their pregnancy declaration at any time in writing.

### Radiation Safety
- Pregnant students are issued a **fetal badge dosimeter** worn at waist level.
- Dose limits to the embryo/fetus will not exceed **0.5 rem (5 mSv)** over the entire pregnancy.
- The fetal badge is monitored monthly.

### Documentation
- The Declaration of Pregnancy form is available from the Program Clinical Coordinator.
- A healthcare providerâ€™s note may be requested if accommodations are required.
- If a leave is taken, the student must meet with the Program Director before re-entry.
