# Radiation Protection Guidelines

Radiation safety is a foundational component of clinical education in radiation therapy. Students are expected to adhere to all policies and regulations that minimize radiation exposure and protect themselves, patients, and staff.

---

### ALARA Principle
All students must follow the **ALARA** principle:
> **As Low As Reasonably Achievable**

This includes:
- Time: Minimize time near sources of radiation
- Distance: Maximize distance from radiation-producing devices
- Shielding: Use lead barriers or walls when appropriate

---

### Dosimeter Use
- Students are issued a **radiation dosimeter badge** at program orientation
- The badge must be **worn at collar level** during all clinical hours
- **Fetal badges** must be worn at the waist by declared pregnant students
- Dosimeters must not be worn during personal radiologic procedures (e.g., dental x-rays)

---

### Badge Exchange and Monitoring
- Dosimeters are exchanged **monthly**
- Students are responsible for **picking up and returning badges** on time
- Badge readings are monitored by the Program Clinical Coordinator
- If dose readings exceed safe limits, the student will be counseled and required to complete a **radiation safety review**

---

### In-Treatment Room Behavior
- Students must stand **behind appropriate shielding** during radiation exposures
- Never remain in the treatment room during beam-on conditions unless instructed and shielded (e.g., total body irradiation scenarios)
- Students should not position themselves between the beam and the patient

---

### Equipment Safety
Students must:
- Report malfunctioning safety devices immediately
- Confirm safety interlocks are functional before treatment delivery
- Follow manufacturer and site-specific protocols

---

### Disciplinary Action
Non-compliance with radiation protection policies may result in:
- Immediate removal from clinical duties
- Written counseling or disciplinary action
- Possible dismissal from the program for repeated or severe violations

---

### Summary
Protecting yourself and others from unnecessary radiation exposure is a legal, ethical, and professional responsibility. Always prioritize safety and follow program protocols.
