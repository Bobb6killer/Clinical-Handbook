# Compensation Time Guidelines

In situations where students work beyond the standard clinical hours due to site needs (e.g., machine downtime, extended treatments, participation in special procedures), compensatory time ("comp time") may be granted.

### Eligibility for Comp Time
- Must be **pre-approved** by the Clinical Instructor or Program Clinical Coordinator
- Must be directly related to **clinical education activities**
- Must be accurately **recorded in Trajecsys** using the "Comp Time Earned" designation

### Using Comp Time
- Comp time must be **used within the same semester** it is earned
- Time off must be **scheduled in advance** and approved by the Clinical Instructor
- When using comp time, students must log the time off in Trajecsys as "Comp Time Used"

### Restrictions
- Comp time cannot be used to shorten scheduled clinical hours regularly
- Excessive accumulation without use may not be permitted
- Comp time is **not transferable** between semesters

### Tracking
It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to:
- Monitor their earned/used comp time balance
- Maintain communication with their Clinical Instructor about planned use
- Ensure entries in Trajecsys are complete and accurate

Failure to properly log or misuse comp time may result in loss of time credit or disciplinary action.
