# MRI Environment Screening

Students may rotate through clinical areas where Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is performed or located nearby. MRI environments contain strong magnetic fields that pose serious safety risks if appropriate precautions are not followed.

---

### MRI Safety Overview
- MRI machines use a **strong, static magnetic field** that is always active
- Ferromagnetic objects can become **dangerous projectiles**
- Electronic devices (e.g., pacemakers, insulin pumps) may **malfunction or be damaged**

---

### Student Responsibilities
Before entering an MRI environment, students must:

✅ Complete MRI safety training at their clinical site  
✅ Review the site-specific **MRI screening checklist**  
✅ Submit a completed **MRI screening form** to the Clinical Instructor

---

### Prohibited Items in MRI Zones
Students must not enter MRI-controlled zones with:

- Cell phones or smartwatches  
- Credit cards or magnetic key cards  
- Metal tools or pens  
- Jewelry, piercings, or hair clips  
- Hearing aids or glasses with metal frames  
- Any implanted medical devices (unless cleared)

---

### Emergency Situations
In the event of a Code Blue or other emergency in an MRI suite:
- Do **not** enter the scanner room unless instructed by MRI staff
- Call for help and report to the **control area** or designated responder zone

---

### Reporting Changes
If a student:
- Gets a new piercing, implant, or device
- Experiences a change in health status

They must complete a **new MRI screening form** before re-entering MRI environments.

---

### Summary
MRI environments are safe **when procedures are followed**. Always respect the signage and rules posted at each site, and never assume an area is safe to enter without proper clearance.
